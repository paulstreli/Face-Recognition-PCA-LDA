# Face-Recognition-PCA-LDA
This repository contains the final results for my first Pattern Recognition Coursework that I completed with my partner Karoly. Face recognition is the problem of identifying a human, based on a picture of their face. In this coursework various face-recognition algorithms are investigated, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and PCA-LDA Ensemble in different variations. The recognition accuracies of the models are compared and advantages and disadvantages are determined.
